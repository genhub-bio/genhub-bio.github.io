In the last post, we looked at a simplified example of editing an _E. coli_ genome and incorporating the sequenced
variants into a shared sequence graph.  In this post we'll build on that a bit by showing an in-terminal sequence viewer
we created for gen that you can use to look at changes.

To load the viewer, just run "gen view":

{% highlight shell %}
➜ gen view
{% endhighlight %}

Running this in the _E. coli_ repo, we get this as the initial screen:

![Initial screen](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view1.png)

The reference genome is the default selection.  If you hit return, you see a zoomed-out view of the sequence:

![Reference view](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view2.png)

You can hit "+" to zoom in on it a bit:

![Zoomed in reference](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view3.png)

If you hit "Escape" to return to the sample list, you can then hit the down arrow to select the next sequence graph,
with the deletion:

![Intentional deletion edit](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view4.png)

You can use the arrow keys to navigate around the graph:

![Navigation to deletion](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view5.png)

Again, you can hit "+" to expand one of the sequence nodes:

![Zoomed in deleted region](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view6.png)

If you hit "Escape" again, you can then hit the down arrow again to select the last sequence graph:

![Sequenced graph](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view7.png)

This is the sequence graph with changes from sequencing.  As before, you can navigate around them and expand on a node
with "+":

![Navigation around variant graph](../../../../../post-files/gen-view/view8.png)

This is just a quick demonstration of our sequence graph viewer.  We have a lot more planned for it, but it's ready to
use, and quite fun to play around with.  Try it out and let us know how it goes!
