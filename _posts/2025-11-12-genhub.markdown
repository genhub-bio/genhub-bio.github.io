In our [first post](https://www.genhub.bio/blog/2025/10/20/a-first-look-at-gen), we showed a simple use of gen, our
command line tool, for tracking an intended edit and then incorporating sequenced variants into a single lineage.  In
our [second post](https://www.genhub.bio/blog/2025/11/3/gen-view-e-coli), we showed how to use gen's built-in sequence
graph viewer to look at the changes.  In this post, we'll introduce our website for viewing sequence "repositories" or
"repos" for short, which are similar to Github repos.

We'll start with the [main page](https://www.genhub.bio/dashboard) that lists all the repos.  If you sign up for an
account, you can pull down a repo or push one of your own.

In the first blog post, we created a local repo and then made changes to an _E. coli_ genome.  We've since [pushed that repo to
GenHub](https://www.genhub.bio/repos/david%40genhub.bio/e-coli-example).  Let's take a look at it.

![Repo page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genhub-bio/genhub-bio.github.io/refs/heads/main/post-files/genhub/repo.png)

All the files we used in the example are present: The reference _E. coli_ fasta (U00096.3.fa), the empty sequence file
we used for a deletion (empty.fa), and the VCF whose changes we incorporated (lacZ-partial-deletion-sequenced.vcf).

There is also a database file (default.db), that contains all the information about the changes from the two operations.
You can click on the row for the database file, and it [launches a
viewer](https://www.genhub.bio/repos/david%40genhub.bio/e-coli-example/database?database=.gen%2Fdefault.db&collection=default&sample=lacZ-partial-deletion&blockgroup=U00096.3&branch=main&operation=)
for the sequence graphs for the various samples.  If you select the default collection, lacZ-partial-deletion for the
sample, and U00096.3 for the block group, here's what you see:

![Deletion view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genhub-bio/genhub-bio.github.io/refs/heads/main/post-files/genhub/deletion-view.png)

If you change the sample to lacZ-partial-deletion-sequenced, you can view the sequence graph with both the deletion and
the incorporated variants.

Actually, at present you will see a very zoomed-out version of the graph.  You can zoom in:

![Variants view zoomed in](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genhub-bio/genhub-bio.github.io/refs/heads/main/post-files/genhub/variants-zoomed.png)

If you click on the operations tab, you can see the [operations we used in this
repo](https://www.genhub.bio/repos/david%40genhub.bio/e-coli-example?tab=operations&branch=main), the associated files,
and the timestamp:

If you have a branch that you'd like someone to review before applying the changes, you can [create a pull
request](https://www.genhub.bio/repos/david%40genhub.bio/e-coli-example?tab=pull-requests&branch=main).  We'll be
talking about branches and operations in a later post.

![Pull request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genhub-bio/genhub-bio.github.io/refs/heads/main/post-files/genhub/pull-request.png)

And also similar to Github, you can create [an issue regarding something about the
repo](https://www.genhub.bio/repos/david%40genhub.bio/e-coli-example?tab=issues&branch=main):

We saw earlier that you can use gen to track changes made or discovered for a sequence.  Hopefully this post shows how
you can share and collaborate with others on those sequence changes using GenHub.  We hope you find it useful!

If you want to download gen and try it out, here is the [page with the latest releases](https://github.com/genhub-bio/gen/releases).
